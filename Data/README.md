# Wildfire prediction dataset

There are 2 datasets in this folder.

# Wildfires_dataset_(12) contains 12 columns (12 parameters): -

 This dataset has all the Weather Index Codes as promised in last semester along with the month of the year in which they were recorded and a clear fire/no fire classification.
 
 The only downside is that it contains only 761 rows of data.
 
 # Wildfires_dataset_(22) contains 22 columns (22 parameters): -

 This dataset has all the raw parameters that determine the Weather Index Codes along with the values in burn date column acting as an indication of fire but no clear fire/no fire classification.
 
 The only downside is that it contains very few of the Weather Index values that we promised in  class and the raw parameters would have to be used in calculating the indices first before making any prediction.
