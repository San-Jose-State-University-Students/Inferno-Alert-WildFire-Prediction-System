# Wildfire prediction dataset

There are 2 datasets in this folder.

# Wildfires_dataset_(12) contains 12 columns (12 parameters): -

 This dataset has all the Weather Index Codes as promised in last semester along with the month of the year in which they were recorded and a clear fire/no fire classification.
 
 The only downside is that it contains only 761 rows of data. However, it contains every parameter that can effectively predict the fire as shown in the following diagram taken from Canadian Wildland Fire Information Agency.
